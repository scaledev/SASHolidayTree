/* HOLIDAY TREE CODE */

* Make your log into a yule log with a beautiful holiday tree;

/* I added the variables to make it customizable and move it away from the center */

/* About the "Substring" substr function:
  Its inputs are (source,position,shift)
 Here our source is a repeated series of leaves *0
  Our Position is 1
  And, the number of characters from our starting position is 2*i+1
